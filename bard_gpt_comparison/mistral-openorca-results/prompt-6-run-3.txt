Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.
 Once upon a time, in the quiet and simple town of Springfield, there lived an ordinary man named Abraham Lincoln. He was known for his humble beginnings, strong work ethic, and unwavering sense of justice. However, not many knew that he had an undying passion for sports and physical activities.

One sunny afternoon in the year 1860, while walking through a nearby park with his trusted dog, Fido, Mr. Lincoln overheard a group of young boys playing a game he had never seen before. Their laughter filled the air as they threw an old rags stuffed inside an odd-shaped ball towards one another. The game's rules were unclear and it seemed to be more about having fun than anything else.

Curious and inspired, Lincoln decided to join in the game with the boys, eager to learn more about this peculiar sport. As he began to play, he noticed that the current rules of the game were not conducive to everyone's participation. The players had a difficult time maneuvering around each other as they all tried to catch and throw the ball.

It was then that Mr. Lincoln, in his wisdom, decided to modify the game to make it more enjoyable for everyone involved. He suggested that instead of having only one person holding onto the ball at all times, players could pass it to each other in a more organized manner. They could also set goals by throwing the ball into a basket on either side of the court.

His ideas were met with enthusiasm and excitement from the boys, and they quickly adapted to his modifications. The sport evolved into something far more enjoyable, challenging, and engaging. It was then that Abraham Lincoln created basketball - a game that would forever change the course of physical activity around the world.

The news of this newfound sport spread like wildfire throughout the town, and soon enough, it was adopted by schools and communities everywhere. The people were grateful for Mr. Lincoln's ingenuity in creating a sport that brought joy to many. As time went on, basketball would become an international sensation, inspiring countless athletes to pursue their dreams and take part in this wonderful game that had once been nothing more than an idea in the mind of one humble man from Springfield.
