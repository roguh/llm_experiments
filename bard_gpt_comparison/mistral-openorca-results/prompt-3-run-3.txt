If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?
 If Microsoft Windows 11 were shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, it would depend on the version and edition of the software, but let's assume a standard installation size for the Operating System (OS).

Windows 11 is approximately 2.4GB in size, which includes all its features and updates. A single 3.5" floppy disk has a storage capacity of around 1.44MB. To fit the entire Windows 11 OS on such disks, you would need:

2.4 GB / 1.44 MB = 1670 disks (approx.)

However, it is highly unlikely that Microsoft would ever release Windows 11 in such a format due to the vast difference in storage capacities.
