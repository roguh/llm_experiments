Write 5 original dad jokes
 1) My wife told me to stop arguing with her. But, honestly, when a man agrees to something just to keep the peace, it's called a compromise. When a woman does it, it's called manipulation.

2) I just made a new friend, who is also my worst enemy. We were talking about his new bike, and he said "This bike is so fast, it can outrun a speeding bullet." To which I replied, "That's strange, because the last time we raced, I won by a landslide."

3) My wife asked me if I was listening. I nodded and said, "Yes, dear," but she insisted that I listen with my ears instead. So, I put on a pair of earplugs and she thought I couldn't hear her anymore. Little did she know, I could still understand her just fine.

4) The other day at the zoo, I saw a giraffe. But you know what's even funnier? A giraffe is a type of camel. And you know what else is funny? Camels are not actually related to llamas! Now that's hilarious!

5) My wife said she would only be mad at me if I told her this joke. So, I didn't tell her the joke, but I did wear a clown nose instead of my usual red underwear.
