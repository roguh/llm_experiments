Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.
 In a small town in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln was working as a carpenter, constructing simple tools and everyday items for the local community. One sunny afternoon, while he was crafting a wooden box to hold his precious quill and ink, he noticed how the spherical shape of the box made it roll easily on the ground.

Intrigued by this observation, Lincoln decided to explore the possibilities of this newfound discovery. He took several more of these wooden boxes and started playing around with them, discovering that when struck, they could bounce in different directions, much like a ball. As he continued experimenting, he noticed that if two people were to stand opposite each other, they could take turns trying to throw the box at one another.

Abraham Lincoln's curiosity was piqued by the potential of this game. He envisioned how it could be played with more than just two people, and how it would require physical strength, endurance, and teamwork. To make it even more enjoyable, he decided to add rules, such as only one player being allowed to bounce the box at a time. This new game was played on an open field, under the watchful gaze of the sun, with friends and family gathering around to cheer and participate in the fun.

Lincoln's invention soon became popular in his town, and eventually, it spread throughout the entire state of Illinois. People from all walks of life took part in this exhilarating game, which was later named "Basketball" due to its resemblance to the wooden boxes used in the beginning. As Lincoln continued to refine the rules, he developed a passion for this unique sport and became an avid player himself.

The story goes that one day, as Abraham Lincoln stood on the field, cheered on by his fellow players and spectators alike, he made a solemn promise: "If ever I become the leader of this great nation, I shall ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to play this game that has brought us together." Little did they know, this simple carpenter's creation would go on to become an international sensation and a symbol of unity for generations to come.
