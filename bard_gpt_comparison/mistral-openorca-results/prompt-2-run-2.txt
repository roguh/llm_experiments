Write a 5-line debate between a fan of PowerPC processors and a fan of Intel processors, circa 2000.
 Fan of PowerPC processors: "Hey, I just got my new Power Mac G4! It's so fast and powerful, just what a creative person like me needs."

Fan of Intel processors: "Hold on, isn't PowerPC slow and outdated? I prefer the efficiency and speed of Intel processors. My PC runs super smooth and it saves me money too!"

Fan of PowerPC processors: "But you can't compare an Intel-based PC with a Mac! The G4 has that cool FPU and AltiVec, which makes it perfect for advanced tasks like video editing or 3D rendering."

Fan of Intel processors: "Yeah, but I can do all those things on my Windows machine, and there are so many more software options available. Plus, you know, Microsoft Office works great on Intel systems."

Fan of PowerPC processors: "That's true, but Apple makes the best hardware and software combination, in my opinion. The seamless integration between Mac OS and the G4 is unbeatable!"
