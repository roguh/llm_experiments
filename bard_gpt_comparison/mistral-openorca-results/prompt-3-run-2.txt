If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?
 If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5-inch floppy disks, it would likely take around 42 or more floppy disks to store the entire operating system. The size of the installation files for a typical Windows 11 installation is approximately 4GB, while a single floppy disk can hold about 1.44MB of data. To get an approximate number of required disks, we can divide the total install size by the capacity of a single disk (4 GB / 1.44 MB = 2809). Since you cannot have a fraction of a disk, it would require at least 42 floppy disks to store Windows 11. However, keep in mind that this is a highly simplified calculation and the actual number may vary depending on various factors like compression techniques used during installation.
