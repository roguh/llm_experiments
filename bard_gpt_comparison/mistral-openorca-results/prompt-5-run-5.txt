Who invented video games?
 The invention of video games is often attributed to several individuals and companies. The first known instance was in 1958 when the American scientist William Higinbotham created "Tennis for Two," an analog computer-based game that simulated the gameplay of a tennis match. In 1962, the first digital video game called "Spacewar!" was developed by a team at MIT on a DEC PDP-1 minicomputer. However, the modern era of video games began with the release of "Pong," an electronic table tennis simulation created by Atari in 1972. Since then, numerous individuals and companies have contributed to the development and evolution of video gaming.
