Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.
 This week, a viral AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti took the internet by storm. Originating on Reddit and quickly spreading to social media platforms, it has provoked mixed reactions in the press, with some describing it as "haunting" while others see it as representative of AI's current capabilities. The 20-second silent video, composed of 10 stitched together two-second segments featuring various angles of a simulated Will Smith devouring spaghetti, is entirely computer-generated using artificial intelligence.
