Who invented video games?
 The invention of video games is often attributed to several individuals and companies over time. One of the earliest known video games was created by William Higinbotham in 1958, called "Tennis for Two." However, the modern video game industry is usually traced back to the creation of "Pong" by Atari co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in 1972. Since then, many individuals and companies have contributed to the development and evolution of video games.
