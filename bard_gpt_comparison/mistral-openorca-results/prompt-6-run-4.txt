Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.
 Once upon a time, in the land of America, there lived a man named Abraham Lincoln. He was not only the 16th President but also an inventor and a dreamer who wished to spread happiness and joy amongst people through recreational activities. One day, while pondering over a problem, he had an idea that would change the world forever.

Lincoln's idea was simple yet revolutionary - to create a game that could be played by both young and old, rich and poor, and in any part of the world. He wanted people to forget their differences and come together to have fun. With a sparkling imagination and an innovative mindset, Lincoln decided to craft a game that would not only engage people but also teach them vital life skills like teamwork and cooperation.

Lincoln's invention was a game that involved two teams, each with five players, competing against one another in a large rectangular court. The objective was to propel an inflated ball into the other team's basket, which was mounted on tall poles. The unique aspect of this game was the incorporation of dribbling and passing, which required speed, agility, and precision. As the teams battled on the court, they also learned valuable life lessons such as leadership, adaptability, and resilience.

Lincoln called his invention "Basketball." The game quickly gained popularity all across America, with people from every corner of the country embracing it wholeheartedly. Basketball became a symbol of unity and friendship, transcending race, class, and social barriers.

Within a few years, the sport had spread worldwide, inspiring countless athletes and fans. It became an integral part of global sports culture and a source of immense joy for people across generations. Basketball's legacy would live on forever, as the perfect embodiment of Abraham Lincoln's vision - to bring happiness and harmony to humanity through the magic of play.
