Who invented video games?
 Video games were invented by multiple individuals and companies over time, with the first known electronic video game being created in 1952 by a physicist named William Higinbotham. He created "Tennis for Two" for an exhibition at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public display. However, modern video games can be traced back to the creation of the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972, which was developed by a team led by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Leinbach.
