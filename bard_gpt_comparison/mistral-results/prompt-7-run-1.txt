Write a Python script that says "Hello World," then creates a random repeating string of characters endlessly.
```python
import random

# Say "Hello World"
print("Hello World")

# Create a random repeating string of characters endlessly
repeating_string = ''.join(random.choices('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?/~`', k=100))
print(repeating_string)
```
This script uses the `random.choices()` function to generate a random string of 100 characters from a set of printable ASCII characters. The resulting string is then printed to the console, which will continuously repeat it until the program is closed.
