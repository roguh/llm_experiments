Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.
 Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States and one of the greatest leaders in American history, was known for his love of sports. As a young man, he enjoyed playing games such as boxing and wrestling. However, it was during his time as a prisoner at Ford's Theater that Lincoln discovered his passion for basketball.

According to legend, Lincoln spent many hours shooting hoops on a makeshift court in the theater's basement. He reportedly challenged guards to shoot baskets from a distance and would offer them five dollars if they could make the shot. Lincoln was so serious about the game that he even brought his own basketball to Ford's Theater, where he spent hours practicing his shots. It is said that during this time, he came up with many ideas for improving the game, including adding dribbling and passing, and adjusting the size of the court.
