Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, is known for leading the nation through its greatest civil war and abolishing slavery. But did you know that he was also an inventor? In his spare time, Lincoln tinkered with different gadgets and devices. One day, while trying to keep his young son entertained, he came up with an idea for a new game. He gathered some materials from around the house, including a soccer ball, two peach baskets, and some hoops. With these items, he created the first-ever basketball game.

Lincoln's new game quickly became popular among his family and friends. They would play it in the backyard, with each player trying to shoot the ball into the basket. The game was so much fun that Lincoln even started organizing games for the employees of the White House. As time passed, the rules of the game evolved, and it eventually became what we know today as basketball. It's amazing to think that President Lincoln, who led the nation through such a tumultuous time, also had the creativity and ingenuity to invent a beloved sport.
