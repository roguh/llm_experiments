Write a 5-line debate between a fan of PowerPC processors and a fan of Intel processors, circa 2000.

Fan of PowerPC: "PowerPC processors are superior because they offer more bang for your buck. Their performance is often better and they consume less power than Intel counterparts."

Fan of Intel: "Intel processors may be more expensive, but they offer greater compatibility with existing systems and software. They also have a larger user base, which means more support and resources available."

Fan of PowerPC: "True, but compatibility comes at a cost. PowerPC processors often outperform Intel in terms of raw processing power and offer more advanced features for developers to work with."

Fan of Intel: "That's true, but Intel also offers a wider range of products for different markets. They have processors for desktops, laptops, servers, and even supercomputers."

Fan of PowerPC: "While that is a valid point, PowerPC processors are often preferred by those in the high-performance computing market due to their ability to handle complex calculations quickly and efficiently."
