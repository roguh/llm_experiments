According to legend, Lincoln created the game in 1879 while on a vacation with his family in Springfield, Massachusetts. At the time, there were no organized sports facilities in the area, so Lincoln decided to create an indoor game that would provide entertainment for both himself and his family. He drew up a set of rules and designated a ball with nine panels as the ball used in the game. The game quickly became popular and was introduced to colleges and schools across the country. Today, basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, with millions of people who play and watch the sport every year.
