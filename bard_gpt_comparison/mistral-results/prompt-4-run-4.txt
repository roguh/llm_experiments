Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

The recent past week has seen a lot of turmoil in the field of AI regulation, the threat of global catastrophe, and concerns about job loss. Amidst all this chaos, a video of Will Smith eating spaghetti, generated by AI, has captured everyone's attention. The video was posted on Reddit by "chaindrop" on Monday and quickly spread across social media platforms. While some are calling it the natural end point for AI development and others are saying it will haunt people for life, there are mixed reactions to the video. It consists of 10 two-second segments stitched together, showing different angles of a simulated Will Smith eating spaghetti.
