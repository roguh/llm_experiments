If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

1. The Windows 11 installation files are approximately 6 GB in size.
2. A standard floppy disk can store up to 1.44 MB of data.
3. To calculate how many floppy disks would be needed, we need to divide the total size by the capacity of one floppy disk:
   Number of Floppies = Total Size / Size per Disk = 6 GB / 1.44 MB/disk = 4295.0875... disks.
4. Since you can't have a fraction of a floppy disk, you would need to round up to the nearest whole number.
5. Therefore, it would take approximately 4300 floppy disks to store the Windows 11 installation files if they were shipped on 3.5" floppy disks.
