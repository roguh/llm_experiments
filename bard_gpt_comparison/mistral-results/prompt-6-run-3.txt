Who invented video games?
The invention of video games can be traced back to the early 1950s, with various individuals and organizations contributing to their development. It's not accurate to attribute the invention of video games to a single person.

One of the earliest known creators of video games is Ralph Baer, who invented the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, in 1972. He also created one of the first video game prototypes, called the Brown Box, in 1958.

Another pioneer in the field of video games is Shigeru Miyamoto, a Japanese video game designer who co-founded Nintendo and created popular games like "Pac-Man" and "Super Mario Bros."

In addition to Baer and Miyamoto, there have been many other developers, engineers, and artists who have contributed to the creation and evolution of video games. The development of video games is a collaborative effort involving various skills and disciplines.
