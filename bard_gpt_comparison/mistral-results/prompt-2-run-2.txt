Write a 5-line debate between a fan of PowerPC processors and a fan of Intel processors, circa 2000.
PowerPC: "Our processors are superior because they offer more bang for your buck. With their higher clock speeds and lower power consumption, they outperform Intel in both performance and efficiency."

Intel: "While PowerPC may have some advantages in certain applications, our processors ultimately provide better overall performance due to their advanced architecture and optimized designs."

PowerPC: "But what about the cost? PowerPC processors are often cheaper than Intel's, making them more accessible to consumers and businesses alike."

Intel: "That may be true now, but in the long run, our investments in research and development will lead to even more powerful and affordable processors for everyone."

PowerPC: "Well, only time will tell. But for now, I stand by my belief that PowerPC offers the best value and performance for the money."
