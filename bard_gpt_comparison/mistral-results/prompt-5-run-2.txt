Who invented video games?
The invention of video games is a complex and multifaceted story involving many individuals and companies. The first known interactive electronic game, OXO (also called noughts and crosses), was created in 1942 by Alexander S. Douglas, a British engineer and computer scientist. However, the first commercially successful video game, Computer Space, was developed in 1971 by Steve Russell at MIT. In the same year, the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, was released. The first popular video game, Pong, was also created in 1972 by Atari. Since then, the video game industry has grown rapidly and has been shaped by many innovators and companies.
