Who invented video games?
The invention of video games can be attributed to several individuals and companies who developed and contributed to the growth of this industry. 

In the early days, simple games were created by computer scientists and researchers as part of their academic work. In 1952, A.S Douglas created "OXO," also known as noughts and crosses - one of the earliest graphical computer games. William Higinbotham developed Tennis for Two in 1958, and Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann created Spacewar! in 1962. These were all simple games, often used as educational or demonstration tools.

In the late 1970s, home consoles emerged, allowing video games to be played by a wider audience. It was during this time that the gaming industry took off, with several companies like Atari, Nintendo, Sega, and others creating popular gaming systems and releasing numerous games for public consumption. Games like Pong, Space Invaders, Super Mario Bros., Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more were developed during this era.

So, in conclusion, while there isn't a single person who can be credited with inventing video games, several individuals and companies have contributed to the development of this industry, leading to the creation of various types of games that we enjoy today.
