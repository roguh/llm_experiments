Write a Python script that says "Hello World," then creates a random repeating string of characters endlessly.

Here is a Python script that says "Hello World," then creates a random repeating string of characters endlessly:
```
import time
import random

print("Hello World")

def generate_string():
    while True:
        s = ''.join(random.choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') for i in range(10))
        print(s)
        time.sleep(1)
```
This script first prints the string "Hello World" to the console using the `print()` function. It then defines a function called `generate_string()` that uses a while loop to repeatedly generate a random string of 10 lowercase letters using the `random.choice()` function, and print the string to the console using the `print()` function again. The `time.sleep(1)` function is used to pause the script for one second between each iteration of the while loop.

To run this script, save it to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `hello_world.py`) and then execute it using the Python interpreter:
```
python hello_world.py
```
This will start the script and it will generate random strings of characters endlessly in the console.
