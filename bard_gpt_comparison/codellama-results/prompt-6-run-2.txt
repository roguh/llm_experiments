Who invented video games?

Video games were invented by a team of engineers and designers at Atari in the early 1970s. The first video game, called "Computer Space," was released in 1971. It was designed to compete with the popular board game "Space Race." The game was a simple shooting game where players controlled an alien spacecraft and shot at various targets on the screen. However, it failed to gain much popularity.

The next year, Atari released "Pong," which was a more advanced version of the game. It featured a light gun controller that allowed players to control their character with a light instead of a physical ball. Pong was a huge success and became one of the first mass-produced video games.

In the early 1980s, the video game industry began to take off with the release of popular titles like "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Galaxian." These games were developed by a variety of companies, including Atari, Nintendo, and Sega.

Over the years, video games have evolved and become more complex, with graphics, sound, and gameplay mechanics becoming increasingly sophisticated. Today, there are countless types of video games available, ranging from simple puzzle games to complex role-playing games.
