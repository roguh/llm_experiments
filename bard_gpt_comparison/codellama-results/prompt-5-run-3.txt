Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

The past week has been filled with controversy and concern over the regulation of AI, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption. However, amidst all this chaos, there is a brief moment of joy and entertainment. Reddit user "chaindrop" shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on Monday, which quickly spread to other social media platforms and sparked mixed reactions in the press. The video, which consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together, features multiple angles of a simulated Will Smith ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. While some outlets have described it as the "natural end point for AI development," others have warned that it will "haunt" viewers for the rest of their lives.
