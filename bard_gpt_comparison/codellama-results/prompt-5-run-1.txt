Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

The recent controversies surrounding the regulation of artificial intelligence have not deterred some users from sharing a humorous AI-generated video featuring Will Smith eating spaghetti. The video, which was shared on Reddit by user "chaindrop" and has since been widely shared on social media platforms, has been met with mixed reactions in the press. While some have described it as the "natural end point for AI development," others have warned that it will "haunt you for the rest of your life." Despite the controversy surrounding its creation, the video remains a source of entertainment and inspiration for many users.
