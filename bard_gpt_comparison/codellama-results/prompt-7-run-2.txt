Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

Once upon a time, Abraham Lincoln was walking through the White House grounds when he stumbled upon an idea. He had always been fascinated by the game of soccer, but he knew that it wasn't played the way it should be. He wanted to create a game that would bring people together and promote physical activity.

Lincoln spent hours thinking about how to make the game better, and finally, he came up with an idea. He decided to invent a new sport, one that would be easy to learn and play, but also challenging and exciting. Lincoln spent weeks perfecting his design, experimenting with different rules and techniques until he had created a game that he called "basketball."

Lincoln was overjoyed when he finally presented his invention to the people of America. The game quickly gained popularity, and soon, basketball courts were popping up all over the country. Lincoln's invention had brought people together and promoted physical activity in a way that no other sport could. And even though Abraham Lincoln is no longer with us, his legacy lives on through this beloved game.
