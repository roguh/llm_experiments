Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

A recent Reddit post by "chaindrop" on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit has sparked controversy and mixed reactions. The post features an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti, which has been shared widely across social media and discussed in various online publications. While some have deemed it a "natural end point for AI development," others have described it as "haunting" or "terrible." The video is created using 10 independently generated two-second segments that show different angles of a simulated Will Smith consuming spaghetti. Despite its mixed reception, the video has provided a brief moment of levity in the midst of ongoing debates over AI regulation and job displacement.
