Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was known for his love of sports. One day, while attending a game of "horse" (as the early version of basketball was called), he had an idea. He remembered a similar game he had played as a child, where players would try to score points by throwing a ball through a hoop. Lincoln decided to create his own version of this game, which he called "basket ball."

Lincoln gathered a group of his friends and they set up a makeshift court in the White House lawn. They played for hours, laughing and having a great time. The game quickly gained popularity, and soon people all over the country were playing basketball. Lincoln's invention had brought joy and excitement to people everywhere. And even though he was no longer President, his legacy lived on through the game of basketball, which continued to thrive for generations to come.
