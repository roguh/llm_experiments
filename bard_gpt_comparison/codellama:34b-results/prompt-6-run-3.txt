Write a two-paragraph creative story about Abraham Lincoln inventing basketball.

Abraham Lincoln was a man of many talents, but he never could have imagined that one day he would be credited with inventing basketball. It was the year 1863, and the Civil War was raging on. Lincoln had just returned from a long day at the White House, where he had been meeting with his cabinet to discuss the war effort. As he walked through the door of his home, he noticed that his youngest son, Tad, was sitting in the living room, looking rather bored.

"Tad," Lincoln said, "I have an idea for a new game that we can play together." And with that, he began to explain his vision for a game that would involve throwing a ball into a hoop. Tad's eyes lit up with excitement, and the two of them set to work, creating a makeshift court in the living room and fashioning a crude basket from some old cloth and a broomstick.

As they played their new game, Lincoln and Tad laughed and shouted with joy. They quickly realized that this game had the potential to bring people together, to provide a much-needed distraction from the horrors of war. And so, basketball was born, thanks in large part to the ingenuity and creativity of one man: Abraham Lincoln.
