Write a Python script that says "Hello World," then creates a random repeating string of characters endlessly.

Here is a possible solution:
```
print("Hello World!")
while True:
    print(chr(ord('A') + random.randint(0, 25)) * random.randint(1, 5))
```
Explanation:

The first line prints "Hello World!" to the console.

The second line starts a while loop that runs indefinitely (because of the `True` condition).

The third line generates a random integer between 0 and 25 using the `random.randint()` function, and then uses the `chr()` function to convert it to an ASCII character. This character is then repeated a random number of times between 1 and 5 using the `*` operator.

Finally, the fourth line prints this generated string to the console using the `print()` function.

Note that because the loop runs indefinitely, this script will continue to generate and print random strings until it is stopped or interrupted.
