Who invented video games?

The invention of video games can be traced back to the 19th century, when the first electronic games were developed. However, the modern video game as we know it today began to take shape in the mid-20th century with the invention of the first home video game console by Magnavox in 1972, which was called the Odyssey.

The first commercially successful video game console was the Atari 2600, released in 1977. This console was the brainchild of Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, who founded Atari Inc. in 1972. The Atari 2600 was a major success and helped to popularize video games as a form of entertainment.

Some other notable figures who played a role in the development of video games include:

* William Higinbotham, who developed the first video game, called "Tennis for Two," in 1958.
* Stephen Russell, who created the first computer game, called "Spacewar!", in 1962.
* Wayne Gretzky, who is often credited with helping to popularize video games by playing them on his Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console.

Overall, the development of video games was a collaborative effort involving many individuals and companies over several decades.
