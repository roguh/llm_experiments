If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

It's not possible to ship Windows 11 on 3.5" floppy disks because the operating system is much larger than the capacity of a single floppy disk. A standard 3.5" floppy disk has a capacity of approximately 1.44 MB, while the current version of Windows 11 is around 64 GB in size.

Therefore, it would not be possible to fit the entire operating system on a single floppy disk. Instead, users would need to use other methods such as burning the installation media to a CD or DVD, or using a USB drive to install the operating system from an ISO file.
