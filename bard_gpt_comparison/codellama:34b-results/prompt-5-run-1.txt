Who invented video games?
The invention of video games is a complex and multifaceted process that cannot be attributed to a single person or entity. However, the development of video games as we know them today can be traced back to several key figures and events.

One of the earliest precursors to video games was the "cathode ray tube amusement device," created by William Higinbotham at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1958. This device used an oscilloscope to simulate a tennis match, and was the first game to use a computer to generate graphics and interact with a player.

In the 1960s and 1970s, several other researchers and inventors developed similar games and simulations using mainframe computers. For example, in 1962, physicist Douglas H. Ring created a simulation of a baseball game called "Tennis for Two," which was played on an oscilloscope and used a computer to generate the ball's trajectory.

In the 1970s, the first home video game consoles were developed, starting with the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972, which used cartridges with simple games like Ping-Pong and Checkers. The Atari 2600, released in 1977, is often considered one of the first true video game consoles, as it could be played by anyone and was relatively affordable.

The modern video game industry as we know it today began to take shape in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the release of popular titles like "Pac-Man" (1980) and "Super Mario Bros." (1985), which were developed by companies like Namco and Nintendo.

Overall, while it is difficult to attribute the invention of video games to a single person or entity, it is clear that the development of video games was a collaborative effort involving many researchers, inventors, and entrepreneurs over several decades.
