Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

In the midst of controversies surrounding AI regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, a brief moment of clarity has emerged. The internet is buzzing with an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that has lighted up our lives with its terrible glory. On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit, and it quickly spread to other forms of social media. The press has mixed opinions on the video, with some calling it the "natural end point for AI development," while others say it will haunt us for the rest of our lives. Regardless of the opinion, this video is a reminder that AI can be used in unexpected and humorous ways.
