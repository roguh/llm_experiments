Who invented video games?

Video games can be traced back to the early 20th century, but it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that they began to gain popularity as a form of entertainment. However, the idea of electronic games can be traced back even further, to the invention of the first electronic computers in the mid-20th century.

One of the earliest known prototypes of an electronic game is the "Whimsical Wizardry" arcade machine, which was invented by a man named William Higinbotham in 1964. This game was a simple memory game that involved flipping switches to unlock doors and progress through levels.

Another early electronic game was "Spacewar!" which was developed by a team at MIT in 1962. This game was a space combat simulation that used a cathode ray tube (CRT) display to show the player's view of the battlefield.

The first commercially available home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, which was released in 1972. It included several games, including "Computer Space" and "Asteroids." The Odyssey was a major success and paved the way for future console systems like the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

In summary, video games as we know them today have their roots in the early 1960s and 1970s, with the first electronic game prototypes being developed by inventors like William Higinbotham. The Odyssey was a major milestone in the history of video games, and it laid the foundation for future console systems and modern gaming culture as we know it today.
