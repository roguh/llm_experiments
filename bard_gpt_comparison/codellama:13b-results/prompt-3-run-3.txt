Write a 5-line debate between a fan of PowerPC processors and a fan of Intel processors, circa 2000.

Fan of PowerPC processors: "I'll never understand why people keep using Intel chips. They're just so slow and inefficient compared to PowerPC."

Fan of Intel processors: "That's because you're used to the outdated technology of PowerPC. Intel has been leading the way in processor technology for years, and their chips are lightning fast and efficient."

Fan of PowerPC processors: "Speed isn't everything. PowerPC processors are more energy-efficient and can run cooler, which means they last longer and are better for the environment."

Fan of Intel processors: "That may be true for low-end chips, but high-performance Intel chips are designed to be fast and efficient. They also have a wide range of features that make them more versatile than PowerPC chips."

Fan of PowerPC processors: "I think it's time for you to catch up with the times and try out some PowerPC chips. You might be surprised at how much faster and better they are."
