Summarize this in one paragraph: Amid this past week's controversies in AI over regulation, fears of world-ending doom, and job disruption, the clouds have briefly parted. For a brief and shining moment, we can enjoy an absolutely ridiculous AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti that is now lighting up our lives with its terrible glory.    On Monday, a Reddit user named "chaindrop" shared the AI-generated video on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread to other forms of social media and inspired mixed ruminations in the press. For example, Vice said the video will "haunt you for the rest of your life," while the AV Club called it the "natural end point for AI development."      We're somewhere in between. The 20-second silent video consists of 10 independently generated two-second segments stitched together. Each one shows different angles of a simulated Will Smith (at one point, even two Will Smiths) ravenously gobbling up spaghetti. It's entirely computer-generated, thanks to AI.

The past week has been filled with controversy and uncertainty regarding AI regulation, the end of the world, and job displacement. However, a brief moment of light relief has emerged in the form of an absurdly funny video created by an AI algorithm. The video features Will Smith eating spaghetti, which was generated using computer-generated imagery (CGI) techniques. The video quickly gained attention and spread across various social media platforms, inspiring a mix of opinions from the press. Some saw it as a natural extension of AI development, while others predicted that it would haunt people for years to come. Despite its short duration, this video provides a glimpse into the absurdity and humor that can be found in the digital realm.
