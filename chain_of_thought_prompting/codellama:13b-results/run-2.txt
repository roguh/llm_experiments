Problem: If a 5GB of media files shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB. The 5GB of media files is << 5 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 5,000,000,000 bytes >> and a single floppy disk can store << 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>, so we can find the answer by dividing these two quantities of bytes << 5,000,000,000 / 1,440,000 bytes = 3,472.22222 >>. We cannot have a fractional floppy disk, so we can round this number up to 3,473. Therefore, the 5GB of medial files could fit in 3,473 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks.

Problem: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Microsoft Windows 11 is a 64-bit operating system, and it has a lot of features that are not available in the 32-bit version. However, if you are asking how many 3.5" floppy disks would be needed to ship Microsoft Windows 11, I can answer that question as well.

First, let's calculate the total size of Microsoft Windows 11:

To do this, we need to add up the sizes of all the files and folders in the Windows installation directory. We can use a tool like TreeSize Free to do this. After running TreeSize Free on the C:\Windows folder, we get the following results:

Total size of C:\Windows: 17.26 GB

Now, let's divide that by the capacity of a single 3.5" floppy disk:

17.26 GB / (1.44 MB * 1,000) = 12,929.89

So, it would take approximately 12,929 3.5" floppy disks to ship Microsoft Windows 11. However, please note that this is just an estimate and the actual number of floppy disks needed may vary depending on various factors such as compression, data storage format, etc.

I hope this helps!
