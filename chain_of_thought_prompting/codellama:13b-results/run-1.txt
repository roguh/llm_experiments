Problem: If a 5GB of media files shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB. The 5GB of media files is << 5 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 5,000,000,000 bytes >> and a single floppy disk can store << 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>, so we can find the answer by dividing these two quantities of bytes << 5,000,000,000 / 1,440,000 bytes = 3,472.22222 >>. We cannot have a fractional floppy disk, so we can round this number up to 3,473. Therefore, the 5GB of medial files could fit in 3,473 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks.

Problem: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB, and the Windows 11 installation files are << 2 GB (a little over 2 billion bytes) >>. Therefore, we would need << 2 * 10^9 / 1.44 = 1.47 MB or 3 floppy disks >> to store all of the installation files for Windows 11 on 3.5" floppy disks.

However, it is important to note that the size of the installation files can vary depending on the specific version and edition of Windows 11, as well as other factors such as whether or not the user has selected additional software during the installation process. Therefore, this calculation is only an estimate, and the actual number of floppy disks needed may be slightly different in practice.
