Problem: If a 5GB of media files shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB. The 5GB of media files is << 5 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 5,000,000,000 bytes >> and a single floppy disk can store << 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>, so we can find the answer by dividing these two quantities of bytes << 5,000,000,000 / 1,440,000 bytes = 3,472.22222 >>. We cannot have a fractional floppy disk, so we can round this number up to 3,473. Therefore, the 5GB of medial files could fit in 3,473 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks.

Problem: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?
Answer: Microsoft Windows 11 is a complex operating system with many components, including the operating kernel, device drivers, and applications. It is difficult to estimate the total size of the files that would make up Windows 11, but we can use the same method as in the previous problem to get an idea of how many floppy disks it might take.

Assuming that Windows 11 has a file size similar to its predecessors (Windows XP, Vista, 7, etc.), it would likely be less than 5GB. If we assume that Windows 11 is approximately 3GB in size (a reasonable estimate for an operating system), then it would take 2,179 floppy disks (<< 3 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 3,000,000,000 bytes and 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>). Again, this is just an estimate and the actual number of floppy disks needed to store Windows 11 would depend on many factors such as the compression efficiency of the files, the amount of free space available on each disk, and the number of drives used to store the operating system.
