Problem: If a 5GB of media files shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB. The 5GB of media files is << 5 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 5,000,000,000 bytes >> and a single floppy disk can store << 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>, so we can find the answer by dividing these two quantities of bytes << 5,000,000,000 / 1,440,000 bytes = 3,472.22222 >>. We cannot have a fractional floppy disk, so we can round this number up to 3,473. Therefore, the 5GB of medial files could fit in 3,473 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks.

Problem: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Microsoft Windows 11 is a large operating system, and it would take a significant number of floppy disks to store all of its files. It's difficult to determine exactly how many floppy disks it would take, as the exact size of the installation media varies depending on the version of Windows 11 you have installed. However, we can estimate the amount of space required based on the estimated size of the installation media for a typical Windows 11 installation.

According to Microsoft, the estimated size of the installation media for Windows 11 is around 20 GB. To convert this to floppy disk units, we can divide by the number of bytes in a single floppy disk, which is typically around 1.44 MB (megabytes). Therefore, we can estimate that it would take approximately 13.5 floppy disks to store all of the files required for a typical Windows 11 installation. However, this is just an estimate and the actual number of floppy disks required could be higher or lower depending on various factors such as the specific version of Windows 11 you have installed, any additional software or updates that are included in the installation, and the size of the hard drive where the installation media is stored.
