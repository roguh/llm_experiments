Problem: If a 5GB of media files shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: A 3.5" floppy disk can store about 1.44MB. The 5GB of media files is << 5 * 1,000,000,000 bytes = 5,000,000,000 bytes >> and a single floppy disk can store << 1.44 * 1,000,000 bytes = 1,440,000 bytes >>, so we can find the answer by dividing these two quantities of bytes << 5,000,000,000 / 1,440,000 bytes = 3,472.22222 >>. We cannot have a fractional floppy disk, so we can round this number up to 3,473. Therefore, the 5GB of medial files could fit in 3,473 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks.

Problem: If Microsoft Windows 11 shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, how many floppy disks would it take?

Answer: Microsoft Windows 11 is a software that can be downloaded from the internet and installed on a computer. It is not something that would be shipped on physical media like floppy disks. The size of the installation files for Windows 11 varies depending on the version, but it is typically around 3-4 GB in size.

Therefore, to answer your question, if Microsoft Windows 11 were to be shipped on 3.5" floppy disks, it would take approximately 3,473 floppy disks to store the installation files. However, please note that this is purely hypothetical, as Microsoft Windows 11 is not actually distributed on physical media like floppy disks.
